Sodium - Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) library for multiple languages

This is based on Flapjax, Yampa, scala.React and a number of other Functional
Reactive Programming efforts, as well as a lot of personal experience. Enjoy.

Status:
  C++ - complete - in separate sodium-cxx repository
  C# - complete
  Java - complete
  Kotlin - complete - in separate sodium-kotlin repository
  Scala - complete but in need of some updating

  Haskell - deprecated in favour of Heinrich Apfelmus's Reactive Banana
