BUILDING SODIUM
===============

To build (from c++ subdirectory):

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

By default, the install is to prefix /usr/local.

Of course, you can use any generator you want. This has been tested with Unix Makefiles and Xcode

e.g., use

    cmake -G'Xcode' ..

To generate an Xcode project
